				<p>The single arm push up is a very demanding calisthenics
					exercise that works the chest, shoulder, and tricep muscles. The
					core muscles, particularly the obliques and hip flexors are thrown
					in for good measure. The lack of support forces the core to work
					harder in order to stabilize the body throughout the movement. When
					done properly, the single arm push up creates full body tension and
					helps you develop more control on specific parts of the body while
					identifying and removing muscle imbalances in the muscles worked.
					Patience and progression are necessary in order to avoid improper
					form and injuries.</p>

			<h3>Instructions</h3>
			<div class="instructionBlock">
				<ol>
					<li>Begin by entering the standard push up position with a
						straight back and your hips over your knees</li>
					<li>Place your hands shoulder-width apart. The legs should be
						the same or slightly wider</li>
					<li>Take your other hand off the ground and place that arm
						next to your side or behind your back</li>
					<li>Slowly lower your chest towards the ground by bending your
						elbow</li>
					<li>Lower your body until your elbow is almost even with your
						back and pause briefly</li>
					<li>Raise your upper body by pushing into the floor and
						straightening your elbow. Be sure to keep your body aligned
						properly until you reach the top</li>
					<li>Repeat as many times as you are safely able and change
						arms</li>
