				<p>The deadlift is an extremely popular (though potentially
					dangerous) lower body exercise. To this day, bodybuilders argue
					about if it is the best vs the barbell squat. The deadlift, when
					done correctly, is highly beneficial. It targets the glutes, the
					hamstrings, the upper and lower back muscles, and the core.
					Additionally, it may be a better exercise for people with knee
					pain, whereas the squat may irritate said knees. The downside of
					the deadlift is that the technique to properly perform it is not as
					beginner-friendly as the squat. Amoung many other coordination
					factors, it requires the individual to be able to properly hinge at
					the hips, which itself must be practiced if living a sedentary
					lifestyle. It is recommended that individuals looking to deadlift
					consult a certified fitness trainer as well as their physician.</p>

			<h3>Insructions</h3>
			<div class="instructionBlock">
				<ol>
					<li>Begin by standing behind the barbell with your feet
						shoulder-width apart.</li>
					<li>Your shins should almost touch the bar (approximately the
						width of one finger away in distance)</li>
					<li>Hinge at the hips while maintaining a straight back. You
						should not be bending your knees just yet. For reference, start
						with your hands on your quads as you hinge.</li>
					<li>Once your hands reach your knee caps or you can't hinge
						any lower, extend your arms down towards the barbell and slowly
						bend at the knees until you can wrap your hands around the barbell
						with the grip of your choice.</li>
					<li>Contract your lats</li>
					<li>While maintaining a flat back, press through the ground
						with your legs to lift the bar. You should be merely holding the
						bar with your hands, not trying to lift with them.</li>
					<li>Once the bar passes your knees, drive with your hips with
						a flat back and contracted lats to continue lifting the bar until
						your legs are straight and your shoulders are back. Your knees do
						not need to be locked out.</li>
					<li>Return to the starting position by hinging the hips with a
						straight back, bending at the knees once be bar passes them, and
						then bending the knees until the bar touches the floor.</li>
					<li>repeat as many times as desired</li>
