				<p>The wall handstand push up is a fun, challenging exercise,
					and an important stepping stone to an unsupported handstand push
					up. This exercise works the shoulders, chest, arms, and back
					muscles with a little bit of core thrown in. The wall handstand
					push up demands great strength as well as the ability to control
					your body from an inverted position. The variation facing the wall
					is easier to get into than facing away from the wall, but may be
					harder to execute for some</p>

			<h3>Insructions</h3>
			<div class="instructionBlock">
				<ol>
					<li>Begin by facing away from the wall and dropping down on
						all fours</li>
					<li>Place your hands shoulder-width apart and kick one or both
						legs back to touch the wall</li>
					<li>Using your legs to drive the motion, climb up the wall and
						walk your chest towards the wall with your hands</li>
					<li>"Walk" up the wall until you are nearly completely
						inverted, using your core to maintain a hollow body position with
						straight arms</li>
					<li>Keeping a tight core, lower your body by bending your
						elbows until they are parallel with the ground</li>
					<li>Once parallel, push through your hands to extend your
						elbows until your arms are straight again</li>
					<li>Repeat as many times as you are safely able and "walk"
						back down the wall to dismount</li>
