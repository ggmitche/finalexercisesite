				<p>The front lever raise is a hard to learn, harder to master
					exercise that is a pillar of both calisthenics and gymnastics. The
					exercise works an astounding amount of muscles. It works
					approximately 5 back muscles in the back alone. Other muscle groups
					involved include the chest, shoulders, arms, core, hips, and legs.
					The front lever raise demands a lot of patience to work up to and
					itself is yet another step to progress to the front lever hold. It
					demands even more patience from taller and larger individuals, as
					every inch adds extra footpounds of downward force to be
					counterracted.</p>
