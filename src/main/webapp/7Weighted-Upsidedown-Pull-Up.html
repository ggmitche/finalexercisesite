				<p>The upside-down pullup is an intermediate exercise performed
					in calisthenics and gymnastics. It is typically performed on a pair
					of gymnastic rings, though it can also be performed by improvising
					with standard gym equipment. This exercise works strengthens the
					lats primarily, along with the biceps, upper back, and core. This
					variation is performed with a weighted vest for added tension.</p>
