				<p>The weighted chin up is a challenging, but accessible
					exercise that works the biceps, forearms, and lats while increasing
					grip strength. This exercise is used to increase your ability to
					pull your body upwards under increased load after reaching
					diminishing returns with standard chin ups. As an added benefit it
					can increase shoulder mobility due to the stretch brought on by the
					added load. As a bonus, the exercise can be done with a weighted
					vest, a belt with weight fastened to it, or a single dumbbell.</p>

			<h3>Insructions</h3>
			<div class="instructionBlock">
				<ol>
					<li>Begin by suspending yourself from a pull up bar or
						gymnastic rings with your palms facing towards you</li>
					<li>Lean slightly backward or push your chest outward towards
						the bar</li>
					<li>Maintain that angle while pulling your elbows down towards
						your ribs in order to pull yourself upwards</li>
					<li>Pull yourself upward until either your chest touches the
						bar or you reach your maximum range of motion</li>
					<li>Lower yourself down into the hanging position and repeat</li>
					<li>Take care to avoid swinging your legs in order to benefit
						more from the exercise and avoid swinging the plate (if using a
						weighted belt)</li>
