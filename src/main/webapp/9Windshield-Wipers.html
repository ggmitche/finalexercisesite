	<p>
		The windshield wiper is a hanging bar abdominal exercise focused on
		strengthening the oblique and rectus abdominus muscles through
		rotation. Those muscles in turn need support from the glutes and hip
		flexor muscles. The hanging variant of this exercise is very
		challenging, requiring grip strength to hang onto the pull up bar and
		more core strength than the grounded variant due to having to
		stabilize the torso in a parallel position relative to the ground. <br>
		Beginners should start with the lying variant and develop their grip
		strength for hanging before attempting the hanging variant. A common
		mistake people make is to abuse the momentum gained by the legs while
		rotating side to side, taking the work away from the abs and creating
		what is almost a light bouncing motion. Care should be made to move
		slowly and deliberately while squeezing the abs in order to gain the
		maximum benefit from the work done.
