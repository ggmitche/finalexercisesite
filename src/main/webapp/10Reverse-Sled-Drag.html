				<p>The reverse sled walk is a very effective leg exercise that
					is rapidly becoming more popular with young athletes and the
					elderly alike. The reverse sled drag is a powerful tool used to
					develop the calves, glutes, hamstrings, quadriceps, and the lower
					back in one neat package. It is very versatile, lending itself to
					either fat burning ( less weight with faster movement) or strength
					development (more weight with more deliberate movement). Even if
					you don't go to a gym, you can simulate the exercise by making a
					sled or fastening chains to a weighted object. If your hips are too
					sensitive for any reason, you can substitute this exercise with the
					reverse sled drag where the rope or chain is fastened to a
					hand-held handle.</p>

			<h3>Insructions</h3>
			<div class="instructionBlock">
				<ol>
					<li>Begin by safely fastening the rope or chains to your waist</li>
					<li>While leaning slightly backwards with your torso, begin
						stepping backwards until the rope or chains are taut</li>
					<li>Continue moving backwards at a pace that is reasonable for
						you at the weight you have chosen</li>
					<li>Keep your knees and toes pointed towards the sled so that
						your joints track naturally throughout the exercise</li>
				</ol>
