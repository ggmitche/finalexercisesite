				<p>Skin the cat is a popular intermediate exercise in both
					calisthenics and gymnastics training. It is used primarily to build
					strength and mobility in the shoulder girdle. It also builds
					strength in the abdominal muscles, the chest, the lats and the long
					head of the triceps depending on the position of your palms
					(pronated or overhand, and supinated or underhand). This exercise
					can be performed from either a pull up bar or with a set of
					gymnastic rings. With patience and proper progression, you can
					greatly increase shoulder mobility and make them highly resistant
					to injury.</p>
